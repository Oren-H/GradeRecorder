# GradeRecorder

## Introduction:

Grade Recorder (name subject to change) would allow Harvard-Westlake students to view all of their grades in real time. Gone are the days of waiting patiently for grades to come out and living in fearful anticipation of what letter will appear on your transcript. Grade Recorder will allow students to keep track of their grades by recording all of the assignments in each official HW class and prompting users for grade inputs. Built-in weighing metrics will be implemented per class, allowing students to see how they are doing real time for each academic subject. 

Value: In addition to giving HW students peace of mind, Grade Recorder will allow students to think strategically about the time they put into each class to improve their GPA and wellbeing.

Competition: To satisfy the competitive aspect of the assignment, users will be given the ability to make bets about their own grades and that of willing participants. Students will be able to gamble in real-time over who will get the highest (and lowest) grade in each class and on each assignment. By betting on the successes of our fellow students, users will achieve a level of toxicity that they never knew they needed. The whole grading system will be gamified like never before!

## User Interactions

### Class Inputting: 
- The user can enter classes that they are currently enrolled in from a list of options. 

- Classes automatically contain inputs for all graded assignments. These assignments are created by website admins and by other students. i.e a student might input "Unit 2 Test" and every other user will be given the option to input their grade for the Unit 2 Test

- Teacher grading scales can also be inputted

Grade Inputting:
- Users will input their scores on all assignments listed for each class

- If an assignment is not lsited, the user can add it manually

- Grades will be autocalculated and displayed

- There will be an option to get a notification everytime an assignment has been graded so the user does not forget to input their grades

## Engagement: 
Users will be drawn to the website due to the convenience it provides in gradekeeping and the entertainment created by the betting feature. 

## Competition:
- Users can bet on who will have the highest grades by the end of each quarter, both grade/school wide, and class wide (different scopes)
- Incentives to be the highest scorer or have the best grades (maybe like a lottery system?)
    - Best grades will win from a certain money pool maybe from gambling ring



## Scalability and Expansion: 
The following goals can be implemented to improve the effectiveness of the website

-  Creating a direct communication between Grade Recorder and the hub, allowing for instantaneous inputting of all assignments graded on the hub

- Creating an app like iHW for displaying grade information.  

- Expanding to more schools 

- Add more features such as likelihoods
    - Highest chance of person having the best/worst GPA
    - Chances of people getting the lowest and highest scores on a specific assignment in a class
    - Chances of person being valedictorian

- Friend groups / people most likely to hate each other by the end of the year

- Who will fall off the quickest (whether in the social scene or grade scene)

## Accessibility and Inclusivity: 
There will be no limits to who can access the website, but some features (such as inputting class specific information) will only be available to students with a harvard westlake email. This does not violate the accessibility and inclusivity law since people without a HW email do not constitute a protected class

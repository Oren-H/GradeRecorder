# HW Sportsbook

## Introduction

HW Sportsbook, a unique twist to the classic Harvard-Westlake student experience, is more than just a grade tracker. It's a full-fledged betting platform, inspired by DraftKings Sportsbook, that allows students to gamble not just on grades but on various high school happenings. Say goodbye to mundane grade tracking and hello to an exhilarating blend of academics and betting.

## Value

This app adds an exciting dimension to student life, offering a mix of strategy, competition, and fun. It takes the typical school experience to a new level, making every aspect of Harvard-Westlake life a potential bet. Also, it may add more ethical value as detailed at the end of this document.

## Competition

Students can engage in a variety of bets, including grade predictions, teacher grading harshness, college admissions outcomes, and even predictions on school policy enforcement. This gamified approach introduces a competitive, yet entertaining, element to the Harvard-Westlake environment.

## User Interactions

### Class and Event Inputting

- Users can enter classes and various school events they are interested in.
- Classes automatically contain inputs for all graded assignments. These assignments are created by website admins and by other students.
- Each class and event will have a list of potential bets, ranging from grade outcomes to school policy enforcement.
- Teacher grading scales can also be inputted.
- Students can create custom bets, subject to approval, for unique and personal predictions.

### Grade and Betting Interface

- Students can input their scores on all assignments listed for each class.
- If an assignment is not listed, the user can add it manually.
- Grades will be autocalculated and displayed.
- There will be an option to get a notification every time an assignment has been graded.
- Students can place bets on different outcomes, from academic achievements to social events.
- The platform will offer real-time odds and updates on all bets.
- A user-friendly dashboard will track bets, wins, losses, and academic performance.
- Each bet is anonymous by default, but users can share their identities if they so desire. They would be verified based on their HW email addresses.

## Betting Categories

- **Academic Performance**: Bet on who will receive certain grades, which teacher grades the harshest, who will be valedictorian/salutatorian, or whether a student will achieve a specific GPA.
- **Clubs and Activities**: Bet on the outcomes of HW sports games/individual player performances. Also bet on who will receive a leadership role in a play or club.
- **College Admissions**: Predict who will get into their top choice or any given college.
- **School Policies**: Bet on whether someone will be honor boarded, dress coded, suspended, or expelled.
- **Teacher Predictions**: Wager on whether a teacher will retire or make specific decisions.
- **Social Bets**: Guess whether a relationship will happen, how long a relationship will last, or the outcome of other high school social events.

## Engagement

The blend of academic tracking and betting brings a unique excitement to Harvard-Westlake students, offering a novel way to engage with the school community. It's extremely addictive. Why? Well, it's gambling, for goodness' sake!

## Scalability and Expansion

- Creating a direct communication between HW Sportsbook and the school hub, allowing for instantaneous inputting of all assignments graded on the hub.
- Creating an app like iHW for displaying grade information.
- Expanding to more schools for inter-school betting leagues.

We could also create betting hubs for other high schools and colleges/universities eventually. This will be the next Wordle, but FAR more addictive. Sportsbook could become Schoolsbook, with Subreddit equivalents for each academic institutions.

## Accessibility and Inclusivity

Open to all; everyone can use features like general grade calculation. Certain features like betting and HW-specific assignment listings for easy grade inputting will be restricted to Harvard-Westlake students (as dictated by their possession of an HW email address) for a tailored experience. In other words, there will be no limits to who can access the website, but some features will only be available to students with a Harvard-Westlake email.

## The Real Secret Sauce

You thought you understood toxicity before, but HW Sportsbook will bring that to a whole new level. However, by turning "serious" topics like grades and college admissions into funny things to talk about/bet on with friends, HW Sportsbook will undoubtedly bring a more lighthearted atmosphere to campus, improving student mental health. 

Sure, we might get expelled for doing this. But at least we can bet on our own expulsions for a profit!

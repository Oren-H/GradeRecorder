# GradeRecorder

## Introduction:

Grade Recorder (name subject to change) would allow Harvard-Westlake students to view all of their grades in real time. Gone are the days of waiting patiently for grades to come out and living in fearful anticipation of what letter will appear on your transcript. Grade Recorder will allow students to keep track of their grades by recording all of the assignments in each official HW class and prompting users for grade inputs. Built-in weighing metrics will be implemented per class, allowing students to see how they are doing real time for each academic subject. 

Value: In addition to giving HW students peace of mind, Grade Recorder will allow students to think strategically about the time they put into each class to improve their GPA and wellbeing.

Competition: To satisfy the competitive aspect of the assignment, users will be given the ability to make bets about their own grades and that of willing participants. Students will be able to gamble in real-time over who will get the highest (and lowest) grade in each class and on each assignment. By betting on the successes of our fellow students, users will achieve a level of toxicity that they never knew they needed. The whole grading system will be gamified like never before!

## User Interactions

### Class Inputting: 
- The user can enter classes that they are currently enrolled in from a list of options. 

- Classes automatically contain inputs for all graded assignments. These assignments are created by website admins and by other students. i.e a student might input "Unit 2 Test" and every other user will be given the option to input their grade for the Unit 2 Test

- Teacher grading scales can also be inputted
    - grading scales should be already preset per class. We don't want users having to tediously place their teachers grading scale in the app. This would make for possible frustration, and maybe confusion on how to use the app unless we have a tutorial or necessary pop-up explaining how to do it. 

Grade Inputting:
- Users will input their scores on all assignments listed for each class

- If an assignment is not listed, the user can add it manually through a very user-friendly screen (better than hub/canvas plz)

- Grades will be autocalculated and displayed. Users can opt in to have their scores be placed on a leaderboard for specific assignments

- There will be an option to get a notification everytime an assignment has been graded so the user does not forget to input their grades

## Engagement: 
- Users will be drawn to the website due to the convenience it provides in gradekeeping and the entertainment created by the betting feature. 

- Students will be excited to create parlays (bets), and can check their rankings among other students across their class or grade. 

## Adictiveness
- Users will need to stay active on the app in order to gamble on different assignemtns and students

- Gamblers often don't like to miss out on gambling opportunities, so this would definitely pull in people who like to gamble

- It would also attract students who don't really like gambling, because grades are quite prominent in everyones life, so it works for a wide range in users/audience

- We could use in-app currency that users purchase with real money. When gambling with "fake" money, people tend to bet more or are more careless with it. This would drive a profit for us, and would cause for even more addiction!

## Competition:
- Users can bet on who will have the highest grades by the end of each quarter, both grade/school wide, and class wide (different scopes)
- Incentives to be the highest scorer or have the best grades (maybe like a lottery system?)
    - Best grades will win from a certain money pool maybe from gambling ring



## Scalability and Expansion: 
The following goals can be implemented to improve the effectiveness of the website

-  Creating a direct communication between Grade Recorder and the hub, allowing for instantaneous inputting of all assignments graded on the hub

- Creating an app like iHW for displaying grade information.
    - No specific assignments here, just classes and grades for simplicity. Maybe here is where the leaderboards would be implemented

- Expanding to more schools around LA and maybe the US.

- Add more features such as likelihoods
    - Highest chance of person having the best/worst GPA
    - Chances of people getting the lowest and highest scores on a specific assignment in a class
    - Chances of person being valedictorian

- Friend groups / people most likely to hate each other by the end of the year

- Who will fall off the quickest (whether in the social scene or grade scene)

- App goes to colleges and universities. College students prolly like gambling more / are more free to gamble, so it would be a smart and profitable expansion

## Accessibility and Inclusivity: 
There will be no limits to who can access the website, but some features (such as inputting class specific information) will only be available to students with a harvard westlake email. This does not violate the accessibility and inclusivity law since people without a HW email do not constitute a protected class
